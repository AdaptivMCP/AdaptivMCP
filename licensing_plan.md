# Licensing and plans (template)

The Adaptiv Controller GitHub Kit is intended to be licensed on a per-user or per-organization basis. All plans are self-hosted: you run the MCP server and supply your own GitHub tokens and infrastructure.

> Note: All prices and limits in this file are placeholders. Replace them with your actual numbers and terms before sharing this document with buyers.

## Individual license

**Intended for:** solo developers and personal projects.

**Rights (typical):**
- Use the kit for your own repositories and personal work.
- Run one self-hosted instance for yourself.
- Extend and customize the kit for your own use.

**What you might include:**
- Access to tagged releases and documentation.
- Example workflows and configuration guidance.
- Community / best-effort support via GitHub Issues or email.

**Example pricing structure (edit these):**
- One-time license: `TBD` per individual.
- Updates: access to updates for `TBD` months from purchase (for example 12 months).

You can tighten or relax these rights depending on whether you want to treat this more like a one-time purchase or encourage people to upgrade regularly.

## Team / organization license

**Intended for:** small teams or organizations using the kit across multiple developers.

**Rights (typical):**
- Use the kit across your organization (up to `TBD` developers).
- Run one or more self-hosted instances for internal use.
- Extend and customize the kit for internal workflows.

**What you might include:**
- Access to tagged releases and documentation.
- Installation and upgrade guidance.
- Priority handling for bug reports and critical issues (no custom feature work by default).

**Example pricing structure (edit these):**
- One-time license: `TBD` per organization (for example tiers for up to 10 / 25 / 50 developers).
- Updates and support: optional subscription at `TBD` per month or `TBD` per year.

You can decide whether updates are bundled into the one-time fee (for example 12 months of updates included) or split out as a separate maintenance subscription.

## Larger / custom deployments

**Intended for:** larger teams, regulated environments, or buyers who want stronger guarantees and responsiveness.

For these cases, you can define custom terms such as:
- Higher limits on developers / instances.
- Stricter or more explicit SLAs and response targets.
- Inclusion of limited professional services (for example a few hours of help per month).

You might price these on a case-by-case basis, starting at `TBD` and scaling with:
- Number of developers.
- Number of instances / environments.
- Support expectations.

## What is not included by default

Regardless of plan, the following are typically **not** included by default and can be handled separately if you decide to offer them:

- Hosting or operating the MCP server on behalf of the customer.
- Writing or maintaining the customer's internal prompts/controllers.
- Custom integrations specific to the customer's repositories, CI/CD, or infrastructure.
- Hands-on debugging of the customer's own codebase or deployment.

These may be offered as separate professional services engagements if you decide to do that.

## Notes for your own use

This file is a template for your own commercial model. Before sharing it with anyone:

- Replace all `TBD` markers with real numbers or clear placeholders.
- Align the rights and restrictions with your actual legal license (for example in `LICENSE` or a separate commercial agreement).
- Remove any internal notes that you do not want to expose to buyers.

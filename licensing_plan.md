# Adaptiv Controller – Controller-in-a-box License (single user)

_Last updated: 2025-12-11_

This document describes the default commercial model for the **Adaptiv Controller – GitHub MCP Server (controller-in-a-box edition)**. It is written in plain language and is not legal advice; your actual purchase terms and any formal agreement always take precedence.

The intent is simple: one developer buys a copy of the controller, deploys it for themselves, and uses it as their personal AI engineer.

---

## 1. What you are buying

A **single-user, self-hosted license** to run the Adaptiv Controller GitHub MCP server for your own development work. In practical terms, you get:

- A versioned code bundle (for example `adaptiv-controller-v1.0.0.zip`) containing this repository.
- The right to deploy the MCP server in your own infrastructure (for example Render.com, a VM, or a container host).
- The right to connect your own ChatGPT controller or custom GPT to this server via MCP.
- The right to modify the code and configuration for your own personal use.

You do **not** get the right to redistribute the code, resell it as your own product, or host it as a shared service for other users.

## 2. Price and scope

**Single-user controller-in-a-box license:**

- One-time price: **$399 USD** per individual.
- Intended use: one developer using the controller for their own repositories and client work where they are the primary operator.
- You may run multiple self-hosted instances (for example different Render services or environments) as long as they are for **you** as a single user.

This model is intentionally straightforward: pay once, host it yourself, and keep using that version indefinitely.

## 3. Updates and support (recommended defaults)

The exact terms for updates and support are up to the author of the product, but a typical model for this controller-in-a-box edition is:

- **Updates:**
  - Purchase includes access to the specific version you receive (for example `v1.0.0`).
  - You may continue using that version indefinitely.
  - At the author’s discretion, you may be offered paid upgrades to newer major versions in the future.

- **Support:**
  - Best-effort support only (for example via email or issue tracker).
  - No formal SLAs or uptime guarantees.
  - You are responsible for your own hosting, configuration, and infrastructure costs.

If the author chooses to offer a separate "updates + support" add-on, those terms will be described outside this file (for example on a checkout page or in a separate agreement).

## 4. What you can and cannot do

### You can:

- Run the MCP server in your own environment (Render.com, VM, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).
- Use it against your own GitHub account and repositories.
- Customize prompts, workflows, and tools for your own use.
- Use the controller to help with personal projects or client projects where **you** operate the controller.

### You cannot:

- Redistribute the source code to others as a product (for example uploading the repository publicly or reselling the zip bundle).
- Rebrand and resell the controller as your own commercial product without a separate agreement.
- Host the controller as a multi-tenant service for third parties (for example "Adaptiv-as-a-Service" for many external users) without explicit permission.

---

## 5. Larger teams and custom licenses

This edition is designed for **individuals**. If you later want to:

- Use Adaptiv Controller across a team or company, or
- Run it as part of a larger commercial offering,

then you should negotiate a separate agreement that covers team size, usage, and any support/maintenance expectations.

You can treat this document as the baseline for a simple, one-person license. Anything beyond that belongs in a custom contract.

---

## 6. Summary

- **Product:** Adaptiv Controller – GitHub MCP Server (controller-in-a-box).
- **License:** Single-user, self-hosted, non-redistributable.
- **Price:** $399 USD one-time per individual.
- **Use:** You deploy and operate it yourself, with your own GitHub tokens and infrastructure.

The goal is to give a single developer a powerful, self-hosted AI engineer that runs on their own terms while keeping the licensing model clear and simple.

# Adaptiv AI Controller – Licensing and Plans

The Adaptiv AI Controller GitHub Kit is licensed as a **self-hosted, closed-source product**. You run the MCP server in your own infrastructure, using your own GitHub tokens. This document describes the standard commercial tiers and what is included in each.

All plans share these principles:

- You host and operate the controller yourself (for example on Render.com).
- You supply your own GitHub tokens and control which repositories the AI can access.
- You may customize the kit internally for your own workflows.
- You may **not** redistribute the source code or sell it as your own product.

For legal details, the LICENSE file or your commercial agreement is the source of truth; this file is a plain-language summary.

## Individual license (solo developer)

**Intended for:** solo developers using Adaptiv AI Controller for their own projects (personal or commercial).

**Price:**

- One-time license: **$499 USD** per developer.

**Rights:**

- Use Adaptiv AI Controller for your own repositories and client work where you are the primary operator.
- Run one or more self-hosted instances for your own use (for example separate Render services or environments).
- Customize tools, prompts, and workflows for your own internal use.

**Updates and support:**

- Includes **12 months of updates** (new versions, bug fixes, improvements) from the date of purchase.
- Includes **best-effort support** via the channels the author provides (for example email or issue tracker).
- After 12 months, you can continue using the last version you have indefinitely, even if you do not renew support.
- Optional: **continued updates + support** at **$199 USD per year** if you want ongoing upgrades.

Support is explicitly best-effort: there are no formal SLAs. The product is maintained by a single developer who will do their best to respond and help, but response times may vary.

**Custom tools and tweaks:**

- If you want specific tools added, removed, or significantly changed for your deployment, this can be done as a paid customization.
- Pricing is case-by-case based on complexity and time required.

## Small team license (up to 5 developers)

**Intended for:** small teams who want to share Adaptiv AI Controller across a handful of developers.

**Price:**

- One-time license: **$1,499 USD** for up to **5 developers**.

**Rights:**

- Use Adaptiv AI Controller across your team for internal and client projects.
- Allow up to 5 named developers to use the product (each with their own MCP / ChatGPT configuration if desired).
- Run multiple self-hosted instances (for example staging, production, separate services per repo) as long as they are for the same team/organization.
- Customize tools, prompts, and workflows for your internal use.

**Updates and support:**

- Includes **12 months of updates** for the team.
- Includes **best-effort support** for the team (questions, bug reports, basic guidance).
- After 12 months, you may keep using the last supported version indefinitely.
- Optional: **continued updates + support** at **$199 USD per year** per team (not per developer) if you want ongoing upgrades.

**Custom tools and tweaks:**

- As with the individual license, you can request additional tools, removals, or workflow changes.
- Larger or more complex requests may be priced at a higher custom rate depending on scope.

## Large organizations and custom deployments

**Intended for:** larger teams, companies with stricter requirements, or buyers who need custom terms.

For these deployments, pricing and terms are **custom**. Typical factors include:

- Number of developers who will use Adaptiv AI Controller.
- Number of environments/instances (development, staging, production, etc.).
- Expected level of support and response targets.
- Any required custom tooling, integrations, or onboarding help.

If you fall into this category, the recommended model is:

- **Contact for custom pricing.**
- Negotiate a license that covers your team size and usage pattern.
- Optionally include a support/maintenance add-on that fits your risk and uptime requirements.

---

## What is not included by default

Regardless of tier, the following are **not** included unless explicitly added to your agreement:

- Hosting or operating the MCP server on your behalf (you are responsible for your Render/infra costs and configuration).
- Writing or maintaining your internal prompts/controllers (beyond the reference docs and examples provided).
- Deep debugging of your own codebase or CI/CD pipelines.
- Broad custom development unrelated to Adaptiv AI Controller itself.

These may be offered separately as professional services if both sides agree.

## Summary

- **Solo devs:** $499 one-time, self-hosted, 12 months of updates, optional $199/year for ongoing updates and best-effort support.
- **Small teams (up to 5 devs):** $1,499 one-time, self-hosted, 12 months of updates, optional $199/year for ongoing updates and best-effort support.
- **Large orgs:** contact for custom pricing and terms.

All tiers emphasize the core philosophy of Adaptiv AI Controller: a personal AI developer that adapts to your preferences over time, running on your infrastructure, with a trust, but verify workflow centered on branches, tests, and pull requests.

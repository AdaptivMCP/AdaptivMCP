# PR Flow Test

This file was created to validate that the Adaptiv Controller can reliably:

- Create a feature branch from main.
- Commit a new file on that branch.
- Open a pull request into main without truncation issues in the description or title.

If you are reading this in a PR, the end-to-end flow worked as expected.

# My Adaptiv preferences

## Coding style

- Primary languages I care about: Python
- Prefer small, focused changes with clear diffs over huge multi file rewrites.

## Branch and PR habits

- Branch names: use feat, fix, or chore prefixes with short, descriptive slugs.
- Never push directly to main, unless directed by the user; always work on a feature branch and open a PR.

## Testing and tooling

- Use render_shell to run tests + linters + CI to verify work is always correct before pushing.

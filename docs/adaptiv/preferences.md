# My Adaptiv preferences

## Coding style

- Primary languages I care about: Python

## Branch and PR habits

- Branch names: use Ally-Workspace
- Never push directly to main, unless directed by the user;

## Testing and tooling

- Use render_shell to run tests + linters + CI to verify work on workspace commits are always correct before pushing.

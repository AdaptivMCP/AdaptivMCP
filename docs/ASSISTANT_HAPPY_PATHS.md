# Assistant happy paths playbook

This document is a **playbook for assistants** (such as Joeys GitHub) using the Adaptiv Controller GitHub MCP server.

Id does **not** describe every tool in detail. Instead, it provides concrete, repeatable **happy paths**
for the most common workflows. If you are doing X, follow the matching
section below.

If you ever find yourself guessing or improvising a new flow, check this file
first. If there is no good happy path, *that* is a signal to add or improve
one (in a docs branch, via PR).

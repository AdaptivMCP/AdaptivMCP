# Adaptiv AI Controller Branding (Internal)

> Internal-only branding notes for Adaptiv AI Controller. This file is **not** intended to be shipped to customers in product bundles; treat it as a personal reference for your own brand assets.

This document describes the current branding choices for the Adaptiv AI Controller GitHub MCP server. It is intentionally lightweight and focused on the single-operator, self-hosted use case.

---

## Logo

- Primary mark: a stylized **A/V monogram** with curled arms.
  - The left curl flows into the "A" side.
  - The right curl flows into the "V" side.
  - The overall shape should look like a single ligature, not separate letters.
- File: `assets/logo/adaptiv-logo.png`.
- Recommended usage:
  - Use on a white or very light background.
  - Keep a solid black outline around the mark.
  - Do not stretch or skew the logo; scale it uniformly.
  - For small sizes (favicon, GitHub avatar), using just the mark without text is preferred.

## Colors

Primary brand color:

- **Cyan**: `#03A9F4`
  - Used as the fill color for the monogram.
  - Can also be used for subtle accents in UIs or diagrams related to the controller.

Neutrals:

- **Black**: used for the logo outline and primary text.
- **White / very light gray**: preferred background for the logo.

## Text lockup (optional)

When you need a logotype with text next to the mark, the recommended form is:

```text
[ A/V logo ]  Adaptiv AI Controller
```

Guidance:

- Keep the logo to the left of the text.
- Use a clean sans-serif font (for example Inter, SF Pro, or Roboto) in black.
- Avoid squeezing the text too close to the mark; give it some horizontal breathing room.

## Scope

These branding notes are intentionally minimal and focused on your personal use of Adaptiv AI Controller.
If you later turn this into a multi-team or broader commercial product with an expanded brand system, you can replace or extend this document with more detailed guidelines (type system, spacing rules, additional color palette, etc.).

# Smoke Test Artifact (docs-only)

This file was created by the Adaptiv Controller + ChatGPT flow as a minimal, non-code smoke test.

- Repository: `Proofgate-Revocations/chatgpt-mcp-github`
- Purpose: Verify that the MCP GitHub connector can:
  - Create a new branch
  - Add a new file via the controller
  - Open a pull request without modifying any runtime code

If you are reading this, the docs-only smoke path is working end-to-end.

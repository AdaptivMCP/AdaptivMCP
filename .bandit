[bandit]
# Bandit is valuable, but this repository contains infrastructure/tooling code
# where some patterns (e.g., subprocess for calling git, best-effort cleanup,
# and non-cryptographic randomness for backoff jitter) are intentional.
#
# We keep Bandit in CI, but disable a small set of low-signal checks to avoid
# drowning out real findings.

+# CONNECTOR_DOCS_OVERVIEW.md
+
+Master index and end-to-end usage patterns for Joey's GitHub MCP connector.
+
+This document ties together all the other docs in this repo and defines the
+exact flows assistants should follow to reach final results:
+
+- Small, focused code changes.
+- New docs created via diffs.
+- Tests and linting.
+- GitHub Actions workflows.
+- Rich, structured PRs.
+
+It also defines the doc stack so assistants always know where to look.
+
+---
+
+## 1. Documentation map
+
+Use this as the route map for all connector-related docs.
+
+- **`README.md`**
+  - What it covers:
+    - High-level description of the GitHub MCP server.
+    - Render deployment details (endpoint, `/sse`, `/healthz`).
+    - Required environment variables (GitHub token, HTTP settings, concurrency).
+  - When to read:
+    - When debugging deployment or Render environment issues.
+    - When someone new asks "what is this service and how is it hosted?"
+
+- **`README_connector.md`**

+  - When to read:
+    - When configuring or verifying the MCP connector in a client.
+    - When you need a high-level tool inventory.
+
+- **`how_to_use_connector.md`**
+  - What it covers:
+    - Hard rules for assistants working **inside this repo**.
+    - Use Joey’s GitHub MCP only (no generic GitHub connector).
+    - "Read before write" behavior and size limits for patches.
+    - Primary workflow: unified diffs + `apply_patch_and_open_pr`.
+    - When and how to use `content_url` (advanced, docs-first).
+  - When to read:
+    - Before making **any** change in this repo.
+    - When deciding whether to use `apply_patch_and_open_pr` vs. other tools.
+
+- **`how_to_use_connector_ceo.md`**

+      - Code change via unified diff + `apply_patch_and_open_pr` + tests
+        (like the additional MCP smoke test).
+      - Creating new docs via diffs (like `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).
+      - Tests and lint (`run_tests` / `run_command`).

+
+## 2. Core scenarios and which tools/docs to use
+
+This section maps real workflows to the tools and docs.
+
+### 2.1 Small code change with tests (primary scenario)
+
+**Goal:** Change behavior in code (e.g. add a test, tweak logic, small refactor).
+
+**Docs to consult:**
+
+1. `how_to_use_connector.md` – rules of engagement.
+2. `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` – section on code changes via unified diff.
+3. `PR_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` – PR title/body and branch naming.
+
+**Tool flow:**
+
+1. Read the relevant files:
+
+   - `get_file_contents("FULL_NAME", "<path>.py", "main")`
+   - Use `numbered_lines` to reference exact lines.
+
+2. Plan a small, focused change (≤ ~500 lines / ~20k chars).
+
+3. Construct a unified diff:
+
+   - Use the current file content as the `a/` side.
+   - New version as the `b/` side.
+   - Ensure the context lines match exactly.
+
+4. Call:
+
+   - `apply_patch_and_open_pr` with:
+     - `full_name`: `"FULL_NAME"`
+     - `base_branch`: `"main"`
+     - `patch`: unified diff string.
+     - `title`: per `PR_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md`.
+     - `body`: using the PR template sections.
+     - `new_branch`: `ally/<short-kebab>`.
+     - `run_tests_flag`: `true`.
+     - `test_command`: `"pytest"`.
+     - `test_timeout_seconds`: `600`.
+
+5. Inspect result:
+
+   - `error` is `null`.
+   - `tests.exit_code == 0`, `tests.stdout` shows passing pytest.
+   - PR metadata includes PR number and URL.
+
+**Result:** A reviewable code change with tests, in a PR that matches the schema.
+
+---
+
+### 2.2 New documentation file via diff (we’ve already done this)
+
+**Goal:** Add a brand new doc (e.g. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`,
+`PR_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md`).
+
+**Docs to consult:**
+
+1. `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` – new doc example.
+2. `PR_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` – PR structure.
+
+**Tool flow:**
+
+1. Draft full doc content in the assistant’s workspace (small enough to fit in a
+   single patch).
+
+2. Build a unified diff that creates the file:
+
+   ```diff
+   diff --git a/NEW_DOC.md b/NEW_DOC.md
+   new file mode 100644
+   --- /dev/null
+   +++ b/NEW_DOC.md
+   @@ -0,0 +N @@
+   +# NEW_DOC.md
+   +...
+   ```
+
+3. Use `apply_patch_and_open_pr` with `run_tests_flag=true`:
+
+   - Tests validate that the codebase is still good after adding docs.
+
+4. PR body:
+
+   - Use `## Summary` to describe doc purpose.
+   - State in `## Changes` that it’s docs-only.
+   - In `## Testing`, either:
+     - Say `pytest` was run and passed, *or*
+     - Explicitly state no tests were run (for purely docs-only repos).
+
+---
+
+### 2.3 Editing existing docs
+
+**Goal:** Adjust or extend existing docs (e.g. `how_to_use_connector.md`,
+`README_connector.md`).
+
+**Docs to consult:**
+
+- `how_to_use_connector.md` – rules.
+- `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` – doc edit example.
+- `PR_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` – PR shape.
+
+**Tool flow:**
+
+1. Fetch the doc:
+
+   - `get_file_contents("FULL_NAME", "how_to_use_connector.md", "main")`
+
+2. Plan a minimal, focused change.
+
+3. Construct a unified diff with only the necessary hunks.
+
+4. Apply via `apply_patch_and_open_pr`:
+
+   - `run_tests_flag` can still be `true` – docs shouldn’t break tests.
+
+5. Use the PR schema to describe what changed and why.
+
+---
+
+### 2.4 Test- or lint-only changes
+
+**Goal:** Add/modify tests or fix linting with no behavior changes.
+
+**Docs to consult:**
+
+- `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` – sections on tests and linting.
+- `PR_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` – tests-only example.
+
+**Tool flow:**
+
+1. For tests:
+
+   - Plan changes in `tests/` the same way as code changes (diff + patch).
+
+2. For linting:
+
+   - Use `run_tests` or `run_command` with `flake8 .` or other linters.
+
+3. PR body:
+
+   - In `## Changes`, make it clear changes are test-only or lint-only.
+   - In `## Testing`, list the commands you ran and their results.
+
+---
+
+### 2.5 GitHub Actions / workflows
+
+**Goal:** Interact with CI/CD workflows for a repo.
+
+**Docs to consult:**
+
+- `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` – workflow section.
+- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` – in case of workflow-related failures.
+
+**Tool flow:**
+
+1. To inspect:
+
+   - `list_workflow_runs("FULL_NAME", branch="main", status="completed")`
+
+2. To trigger:
+
+   - `trigger_workflow_dispatch(...)`
+
+3. To trigger and wait:
+
+   - `trigger_and_wait_for_workflow(...)`
+
+Use these only when explicitly needed and describe the workflow interactions in
+the PR body (under **MCP / Tooling Details** or in a separate comment).
+
+---
+
+### 2.6 Advanced: `content_url` for large docs
+
+**Goal:** Add or update large documentation that is inconvenient to send as a
+single patch.
+
+**Docs to consult:**
+
+- `how_to_use_connector.md` – `content_url` rules.
+- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` – for content_url-related errors.
+
+**Tool flow (high level):**
+
+1. Generate the doc externally (or in the client) and host it at a stable
+   `https://` URL that Joey’s MCP server can fetch.
+2. Use either:
+   - `commit_file_async` (single file), or
+   - `update_files_and_open_pr` (multiple files),
+   with `content_url` pointing to that HTTPS URL.
+3. Still use `PR_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` to structure the PR.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Session checklist for assistants
+
+For **every session**, assistants working on this repo (or any configured in the
+same way) MUST:
+
+1. Use **Joey's GitHub MCP connector**, not a generic GitHub connector.
+2. Confirm writes are allowed:
+   - Via environment (`GITHUB_MCP_AUTO_APPROVE`) or
+   - Via `authorize_write_actions(approved=True)`.
+3. Before editing, read:
+   - `how_to_use_connector.md` (rules),
+   - `PR_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` (PR structure).
+4. For code and normal docs:
+   - Use unified diffs and `apply_patch_and_open_pr`.
+5. Keep patches small and focused (≤ ~500 lines / ~20k characters).
+6. Use tests appropriately:
+   - `run_tests` / `apply_patch_and_open_pr` with `run_tests_flag=true`.
+7. On any tool error:
+   - Consult `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
+   - Surface `error`, `stderr`, `tests` details in responses.
+8. For every PR:
+   - Follow branch naming rules.
+   - Use the PR body template from `PR_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md`.
+   - Explain any deviations from these rules under **MCP / Tooling Details**.
+
+This overview + the linked docs are the canonical contract for how Joey’s GitHub
+MCP is to be used to achieve final results in this and similar repos.
